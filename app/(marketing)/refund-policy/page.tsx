                <p>
                  At R4Referral, we stand behind the quality of our work. We are committed to delivering
                  the services outlined in your agreement. This refund policy explains the circumstances
                  under which refunds may be issued.

                <p>
                  Monthly service fees are charged in advance at the beginning of each billing cycle.
                  Because we begin allocating agent time, resources, and campaign preparation immediately,
                  monthly service fees are generally non-refundable once a billing cycle has begun.
