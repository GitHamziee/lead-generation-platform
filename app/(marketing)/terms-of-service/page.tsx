                  Fees are charged monthly in advance. Payment is due within 5 business days of invoice.
                  Late payments may incur a 1.5% monthly late fee. We reserve the right to suspend

                <p>
                  All payments made are final and non-disputable. The Client expressly waives any right to
                  initiate chargebacks or payment reversals through their bank or card provider. Any concerns
                  or disputes must be addressed solely through R4Referral&apos;s internal resolution process.
                  Any chargeback attempt will be treated as a breach of contract, with R4Referral reserving full
                  rights to dispute, recover losses, and pursue legal remedies.

                  Any request for reconsideration of payment must be formally submitted in writing within
                  sixty (60) calendar days of the original service agreement execution date. Requests made
                  beyond this period shall be deemed irrevocably waived.

                <p className="mt-3">
                  In cases where no material service execution, operational labor, or referral delivery has taken
                  place, the Company shall deduct a non-refundable 15% to cover merchant processing,
                  administrative, and handling expenses.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-3">
                  Once services have commenced — including resource deployment, campaign initiation, or

                  payment to cover labor, infrastructure, and operational costs.

                  sole discretion of the Company. Such decisions are final, binding, and not subject to
                  dispute, chargeback, or third-party intervention unless otherwise required by law.

                <p>
                  Neither party will be liable to the other party for any indirect, special, incidental,

                  Either party may terminate services with 30 days written notice. R4Referral may suspend
                  services immediately if we have reason to believe you have violated these Terms, if your
                  use of the services is fraudulent or negatively impacting the services, or if it has become
                  illegal or impractical to provide the services. Upon termination, all outstanding fees

                  R4Referral services are intended for use by adults only and are not directed at minors. We do
                  not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13.

                <p>
                  Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms does not waive our right to do so in
                  the future. Even if we waive a provision, it is not waived for all time unless it is in
                  writing and signed by both parties.

                <p>
                  If a party fails to perform any obligation due to a cause beyond its control and without
                  negligence, such as a natural disaster, civil or military authority&apos;s action, fire,
                  strike, lockout, terrorist acts, war, riot, or earthquake, it will not be considered an
                  event of default or a breach of these terms. The affected party must take all reasonable
                  actions to minimize the consequences.

                <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-3">Governing Law and Venue</h2>
                <p>
                  The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the enforceability and interpretation of the
                  arbitration agreement section below. Apart from the arbitration provision, these terms will
                  be interpreted according to the laws of the State of New York without regard to any
                  conflicts of laws. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
                  of Goods will not govern these terms. Any legal action arising out of or related to these
                  terms or R4Referral services will be brought in state or federal courts in New York, and both
                  parties agree to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.

              <div>
                <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-3">Agreement to Arbitrate</h2>
                <p>
                  Before initiating any formal legal case, the parties should first attempt to resolve the
                  dispute through R4Referral&apos;s Customer Support. If the dispute remains unresolved, both
                  parties agree to resolve any dispute relating to these terms or R4Referral services through
                  binding arbitration in New York, or any other location agreed upon by both parties. The
                  agreement to arbitrate remains effective even after the parties stop using R4Referral services.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-3">
                  The parties agree that disputes related to intellectual property will be resolved in court
                  instead of through arbitration. The parties agree not to bring claims on behalf of others
                  in any class, consolidated, or representative action. If the class action waiver provision
                  is deemed unenforceable, the entire arbitration agreement will be null and void, but the
                  rest of the terms will remain in effect.
